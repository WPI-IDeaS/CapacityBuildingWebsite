Changes entire systems can also increase the scale of change as it supports change in every individual within the system, rather than only those targeted by a specific program, initiative, or intervention.</span>

                <div>Capacity can be amorphous. It is both <Def tag="HELD">individually and collectively held</Def> and constantly in flux. When
                    we talk about capacity, we include everything that allows us to reach our objectives. This can
                    include resources like funding and labor; it also includes knowledge and how we share meaning.</div>
                <div>Capacity in our institutions is really held in the people, so your capacity building process needs to
                    support the development of people within the contexts that matter to them. That inherently is going
                    to be more dynamic, contextualized, and individualized than staffing a predetermined set of tasks.
                    The questions become, How do you create a process for people that makes them want to come engage in
                    this work and that can connect them to each other? How do you gather and provide the resources that
                    sustain their ability to advance this work within their context, their values, and zone of
                    influence?</div>
            </div>,
            <div>
                When you are building capacity within people for an organization, you need to create the space for capacity to look many different ways, to be greater as a whole than in individuals, and to be fully inclusive and participatory. This is especially the case if you are grappling with entrenched issues in education (e.g., improving instruction, systemic change) and seeking novel solutions: there has to be enough space and play within your design to allow for unanticipated emergent findings and for people in the process to make their own meaning.
